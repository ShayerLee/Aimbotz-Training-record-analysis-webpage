When practicing shooting with AimBotz, I always feel frustrated because once I finish, I can't see if I've made any progress. This really annoys me
So in a fit of pique, I made a website to track Aimbotz's training results

Click to visit: http://www.cs2mashtr.xyz/

After each round of defeating the specified number of bots, Aimbotz will return the data and information of this practice session in the chat box

Just select them, right-click, and you can copy the selected text

Go back to our webpage and paste the line we copied into the text box

For the first time, we need to create a new training plan (project). Here, we take the 10k rifle training as an example. Click the green plus sign and enter our training content

After confirmation, our training project will be created. Then, by clicking on "Recognize Data", the system will automatically extract our training results and generate a table and a line chart

After accumulating a large number of training sessions, you can observe whether your recent performance is gradually improving, and make corresponding adjustments

And this website will continue to be updated. Currently, it has updated the recognition success rate of emergency stop and the killing rate of emergency stop.
